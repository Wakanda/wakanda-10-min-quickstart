# Wakanda - 10 minute Quickstart

Welcome to the 10 minute quickstart solution !

This solution contains a Wakanda application, with the todo list we created
on the [Angular-Wakanda 10 minute quickstart](http://wakanda.github.io/angular-wakanda/#/doc/quickstart).

## Run
Open the solution on Wakanda Studio, then hit *Run Page*. It will launch Wakanda Server,
install npm dependencies then launch the application on a new tab, or on your default
browser.

## Contributing
Think this quickstart could be better? Found an issue? Do not hesitate to open an issue on
[Wakanda issues repository](https://github.com/Wakanda/wakanda-issues) and explain
how it could be improved.

Thanks! :)
